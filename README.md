## Introduction

In this project, we aimed to optimize portfolio weights to minimize tracking error while using stocks from the NIFTY index. Tracking error is a measure of how closely a portfolio follows the index it is benchmarked against. By optimizing portfolio weights, we aimed to reduce tracking error and improve the portfolio's performance relative to the index.

## Data

- We used historical stock price data for stocks listed in the NIFTY index.
- The data included daily closing prices for each stock over a specified period.
- Additional data, such as market capitalization and sector classification, may have been utilized for analysis.

## Methodology

1. **Data Collection**: Historical stock price data for NIFTY stocks was collected from reliable sources.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: The data was cleaned and processed to handle missing values, adjust for stock splits or dividends, and ensure consistency.
3. **Portfolio Optimization**: Various optimization techniques, such as mean-variance optimization or minimum tracking error optimization, were employed to determine the optimal portfolio weights.
4. **Risk-Return Analysis**: Performance metrics such as Sharpe ratio, volatility, and tracking error were calculated to evaluate the risk-return profile of the optimized portfolios.
5. **Visualization**: Results were visualized using appropriate charts and graphs to facilitate interpretation.

## Results

- The optimized portfolios demonstrated reduced tracking error compared to the benchmark index.
- Risk-return analysis indicated improvements in performance metrics such as Sharpe ratio and volatility.
- Detailed results and visualizations may be provided in the project documentation or accompanying reports.

## Usage

1. **Data Preparation**: Ensure that you have access to historical stock price data for NIFTY stocks.
2. **Data Processing**: Clean and preprocess the data as necessary to prepare it for analysis.
3. **Portfolio Optimization**: Implement the portfolio optimization techniques described in the methodology section.
4. **Risk-Return Analysis**: Calculate performance metrics and visualize the results to assess the performance of the optimized portfolios.
5. **Interpretation**: Interpret the results and derive insights to inform investment decisions.
